# This is the instaScript Developer README
## Description
This app will be focused mostly on the location endpoint of the Instagram API (https://www.instagram.com/developer/).\n
Its aim will be directed to making geographical maps of social media activity in determined regions.\n
This is still in early development, and we are currently exploring the API and trying to get information from it.
